# BatchEuphoria
A library for cluster / batch system developers to create batch jobs from Java without any hazzle and drama.

## How to use it

Use `gradle build` to create the jar file.

Currently the library only supports PBS and LSF REST.

First you need to create an execution service depending on the kind of cluster you have.

For LSF REST you need to use the RestExecutionService: 
`RestExecutionService executionService = new RestExecutionService("http://yourServer:8080/platform/ws","account","password")`

For PBS you need to implement your own execution service with the `ExecutionService interface`

`JobManagerCreationParameters parameters = new JobManagerCreationParametersBuilder().build()`

Currently there are two job managers which are `LSFRestJobManager` and `PBSJobManager`
For example for LSF you would initialize the job manager like this:
`LSFRestJobManager jobManager = new LSFRestJobManager(executionService,parameters)`

You need a resource set to define your requirements like how many cores and how much memory and the time limit you need for your job. 

`ResourceSet resourceSet = new ResourceSet(ResourceSetSize.s, new BufferValue(10, BufferUnit.m), 1, 1, new TimeUnit("m"), null, null, null)`

Then you create the Job with job name, submission script, resource set, environment variables etc.

`Job testJobwithScript = new Job("batchEuphoriaTestJob", null, "\"#!/bin/bash\\nsleep 15\\n\"", null, resourceSet, null, ["a": "value"], null, null, jobManager)`

All job managers support the following functions:

- Submit job: `jobManager.runJob(job)`

- Abort job: `jobManager.queryJobAbortion(jobList)`



## Integration Tests
Use `gradle uberJar` to setup the jar file for integration tests.

To test it with LSF environment use `java -jar BatchEuphoria.jar -s yourServer -a yourAccount -rs http://yourServer:8080/platform/ws -ra yourRestAccount -c lsf`

For PBS environment use `java -jar BatchEuphoria.jar -s yourServer -a yourAccount -c pbs`
